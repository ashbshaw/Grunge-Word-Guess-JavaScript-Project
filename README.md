# Grunge-Word-Guess-JavaScript-Project

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION (JANUARY 2019)

This is a word guess game utilizing JavaScript. We were in the early days of JavaScript and learning how to use functions. In this game, the player guesses letters of a mystery word, which is randomly chosen from an array of words. The game is similar to Hang Man. The words are 90's Seattle grunge themed because I love 90's rock (no shame).
